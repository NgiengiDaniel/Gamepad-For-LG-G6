# Gamepad For Android Devices
This project implements the [VUSB](http://www.obdev.at/vusb/) library and a custom [HID descriptor](https://www.usb.org/hid) to create an HID compliant device using the 8bit Atmega328P micro-controllers. The benefit of HID devices is that they work without host side drivers.
